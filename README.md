# Data Science using Stata
Material for the YouTube course "Data Science using Stata: Complete Beginners Course" is available here including slides, data sets, and Stata do files. You can find the course on the channel [YUNIKARN](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCb0qAKEAwNC0FNatapc-yZg) 

## INTRO:

## Lecture 1: Introduction to statistical models and Stata
We explore statistical models and start playing with Stata. I show you how to load data into Stata from Excel or csv files.

## Lecture 2: Exploring data 
I cover data types, sampling issues, outliers, and missing values.

### 2a: Transforming variables 
I discuss whether you should transform variables (e.g., log transformation), how transformation affects linear relationships, and whether variables should be normally distributed for regression analysis. I show you how to AVOID COMMON MISTAKES when transforming variables.

### 2b: Exporting tables
I introduce the estpost and esttab commands, which enable you to export tables from Stata to Word, Excel, or other applications. I show you how to modify formats and optimise the layout. This produces production-ready tables for your dissertation project, consulting report or academic paper. NO NEED TO ADJUST TABLES BY HAND - LET STATA TAKE CARE OF IT!

## Workshop 1: Descriptive Analysis: Worked Example
Now it is your turn! Download the data and try to answer the questions for Workshop 1 (see slides). This video will walk you through a Descriptive Data Analysis step-by-step. We generate new variables, display descriptive statistics, and explore large survey data.

## Lecture 3: Regression analysis
This video explains Regression Analysis without using theory. We will conduct a regression analysis in Stata and interpret the output. In particular, we explore correlations, scatter plots, linear models, OLS, dummies, and predictions.

### 3a: What are Degrees of Freedom?
This video explains the concept of degrees of freedom.  Using artificial data, we illustrate the minimum number of observations needed to determine a regression line in two dimensions (or higher dimensions). We show the impact on R-squared and demonstrate the adjusted R-squared. Using examples, we highlight the impact of additional observations and explanatory variables on degrees of freedom and R-squared.

## Lecture 4: Post estimation analysis

### 4a: What is Multicollinearity?
This video explains multicollinearity and its consequences for regression analysis. We discuss how to detect multicollinearity and how to address the problem. Finally, we demonstrate multicollinearity using data on commodity prices.

### 4b: What is Heteroskedasticity?
This video explains heteroskedasticity and its consequences for regression analysis. We discuss how to detect heteroskedasticity and how to address the problem. Finally, we demonstrate heteroskedasticity using data on yields in farming.

**Chapters**
- 0:00 Welcome
- 0:44 Impact on p-values
- 2:07 Detecting the problem
- 4:56 How to fix it?
- 5:42 Worked example in Stata

### 4c: How to fix an Omitted Variable Bias?
This video explains how to detect and fix an omitted variable bias. If you forget to include an important explanatory variable in your regression model, an omitted variable bias can occur. I explain how you can detect this problem using the Ramsey RESET test. This test also indicates non-linear relationships. We will explore how we can distinguish between non-linear effects and omitted variables using fitted values.
