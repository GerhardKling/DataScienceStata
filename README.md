Material for the YouTube course "Data Science using Stata: Complete Beginners Course" is available here including slides, data sets, and Stata do files. You can find the course on the channel [YUNIKARN](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCb0qAKEAwNC0FNatapc-yZg)

## Lecture 1: Introduction to statistical models and Stata
We explore statistical models and start playing with Stata. I show you how to load data into Stata from Excel or csv files.

### 2a: Transforming variables 
I discuss whether you should transform variables (e.g., log transformation), how transformation affects linear relationships, and whether variables should be normally distributed for regression analysis. I show you how to AVOID COMMON MISTAKES when transforming variables.

### 2b: Exporting tables
I introduce the estpost and esttab commands, which enable you to export tables from Stata to Word, Excel, or other applications. I show you how to modify formats and optimise the layout. This produces production-ready tables for your dissertation project, consulting report or academic paper. NO NEED TO ADJUST TABLES BY HAND - LET STATA TAKE CARE OF IT!
